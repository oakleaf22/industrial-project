Out of the 42 LOs, I have reached full achievement of 11 (26\%), above average achievement of 20 (48\%), and limited achievement of 11 (26\%) (see Figure~\ref{fig:LO_pie}).
Table~\ref{tbl:LOs_summary} summarises my overall achievement levels for all of the LOs.

Interestingly, over the years, my courses and placements have increasingly contributed to my development of the Engineering Council's LOs (see Figure~\ref{fig:cum_courses} in Appendix~\ref{App:matrix}).
In particular, the \LABTitle \space contributed to almost every LO.
The `runners-up' of courses/ placements that have contributed the most to the LOs are \CASTitle, \TPSTitle, \PRJTitle, and Sunamp.
It is surprising that the latter two are runners-up considering my below par performance on the \PRJTitle \space and my very non-technical work experience at Sunamp.






\subsection*{Fully Achieved LOs}

I have fully achieved between one and three LOs from every category.
These have to do with my:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Awareness of and ability to investigate emerging technologies [SM4m, EA5m]
	\item Ability to understand and evaluate user needs [D1(i, -)]
	\item Ability to define and investigate problems [D2(i, -)]
	\item Ability to communicate to technical and non-technical audiences [D6]
	\item Understanding of the need for sustainable development [EL4(i, -)]
	\item Awareness of legal requirements governing engineering activities [EL5(-, m)]
	\item Laboratory skills [P3(i, -)]
	\item Awareness of quality issues and their application to continuous improvement [P7]
	\item Ability to apply additional general skills, e.g. effectively use general IT facilities and exercise personal responsibility in a team [G1, G4(i, -)]
\end{itemize}

Most of the LOs I have fully achieved are related to things I am highly interested in, notably meeting a client's needs, the need for monitoring and evaluation in continuous improvement, and the benefits of developing technologies, all in the interest of sustainable development.




\subsection*{Limited Achievement of LOs}

However, this analysis has highlighted several skills in which I am deficient and need to work harder on to develop.
According to Table~\ref{tbl:LOs_summary}, these have to do with my limited:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Understanding of mathematical and computational models [SM5m]
	\item Ability to work with unfamiliar, uncertain or incomplete information [EA6m, D3(i, b, m), P8]
	\item Knowledge of management techniques [EL3(i, b, m)]
	\item Limited understanding of key drivers for business success [EL7m]
	\item Ability to use technical literature, codes of practice and industry standards [P4(i, -), P6(i, -)]
	\item Knowledge of contractual and legal issues [P5]
	\item Understanding of current practice [P9m]
	\item Ability to apply engineering techniques while considering commercial and industrial constraints [P10m]
\end{itemize}

Additionally, Figure~\ref{fig:cum_LOs} in Appendix~\ref{App:matrix} shows two LO attainment levels that I have no experience in:
\begin{itemize}
	\item EA3m: Ability to apply quantitative and computational methods, using alternative approaches and understanding their limitations, in order to solve engineering problems and implement appropriate action
	\item D4: Apply advanced problem-solving skills, technical knowledge and understanding, to establish rigorous and creative solutions that are fit for purpose for all aspects of the problem including production, operation, maintenance and disposal
\end{itemize}


Table~\ref{tbl:LOs_summary} shows that 55\% of the LOs I have limited achievement in are under the Engineering Practice (P) category.
I believe I should be able to strengthen these skills once I start to work in industry.
Another overarching theme is my difficulty working with uncertain information.
This is most likely linked to my perfectionist and risk-averse tendencies.
To overcome this, I need to practise using my best judgment, making quicker decisions and generally taking more risks.
