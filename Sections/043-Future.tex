\section{Future Learning and Career Aspirations}

\hl{Future aspirations.}
I think I would like to build my career in Sweden because it is a safe and profitable (?) place to work and live with many benefits, e.g. parental leave, and I would be close to my family.
I would really like to work towards improving the sustainability of buildings.
Sweden is pretty well known for their environmentally conscious efforts and their sustainability, e.g. with their recycling, their district heating systems, their high building standards with regards to U-values etc.
I think I could learn a lot about increasing sustainability in the built environment by working for an environmentally responsible construction or consulting company in Sweden.
Perhaps after that I will stay/ remain in Sweden or share my knowledge somewhere else in the world where it is more needed.
This is why I looked for a summer placement in Sweden this year, so I could ``get my foot in the door", make contacts and find opportunities for work once I graduate next year.
