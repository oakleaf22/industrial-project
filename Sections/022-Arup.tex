%\subsection{Mechanical Engineering Summer Placement at Arup in Leeds}

In the summer after second year, I was excited to have earned a mechanical engineering placement with the world-renowned company, Arup, in Leeds' Buildings team.
I was responsible for sizing ducts and pipes and for producing the RIBA Stage 3\footnote{Of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Plan of Work 2013.}
layouts and schematics of a new-buildâ€™s ventilation, heating and domestic water systems (see Figure \ref{fig:arup_schematics}).
This placement gave me my first hands-on experience in designing and sizing such systems.
I appreciated the level of responsibility (and its associated challenge) that I was given since Day 1.
I was also introduced to some of the work the electrical engineers did.

The work experience prepared me for future courses such as \textit{Electrical and Lighting Services for Buildings} and the 4\textsuperscript{th} year \textit{Design Project}.
I was encouraged to hear about Arup's sustainable mindset to designing and felt like I could become competent and may enjoy a job as a consulting engineer in the future.
