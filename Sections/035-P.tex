\section{Engineering Practice (P)}


\subsection*{P1(i, -)}

Throughout the programme, I have gained a knowledge and understanding of some contexts in which my Architectural Engineering knowledge can be applied.
The following list in which I describe such contexts is not exhaustive.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The collaborative design projects in years \hl{1/2} and 4,
	\textit{Building Services Technology},
	\textit{Introduction to the Environment},
	\textit{Design Project A},
	\textit{Design Project B},
	\textit{Electrical and Lighting Services for Buildings},
	\textit{Critical Architectural Studies},
	\textit{Design Project},  
	and my placements at Arup and Hoare Lea
	provided me with the practical experience of applying my AE knowledge in the context of a team designing a building and/ or its services, in which I was responsible for the building services, the building's internal environment and the occupants' comfort levels.
	
	\item Through
	\textit{Acoustics and Architectural Design},
	\textit{Environment and Behaviour},
	\textit{Energy Principles and Applications},
	\textit{Energy and Buildings},
	\textit{Thermal Performance Studies},
	\textit{Design Issues},
	\textit{Facilities Management Principles},
	\textit{Laboratory Project},
	\textit{Sustainable and Intelligent Buildings},
	\textit{Climate Change, Sustainability and Adaptation},
	\textit{Water Supply and Drainage for Buildings},
	my work in the environmental certification of existing buildings at Sweco,
	and
	my encounter with a specialist in Performance at Hoare Lea,
	Design Issues,
	I have also learned that my AE knowledge is applicable in the operation and management of buildings and building services (a.k.a. facilities management) to, for example, improve the occupants' comfort levels, optimise performance or increase resilience to future impacts of climate change.
	
	\item Through the work I did at Sunamp as well as my encounter with a technical author at Hoare Lea, I understand that engineering knowledge is important in the composition of technical documents (e.g. specifications, operation and maintenance manuals) and even marketing material for technical products, which may need to explain engineering processes in layman's terms.
	
	\item My \textit{Dissertation} in particular taught me that engineering knowledge is necessary for the development of industry standards and codes of practice, such as the series of Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) 1192 which standardise the requirements for achieving BIM Level 2.
	
	\item Throughout my \textit{Dissertation} and \textit{Climate Change, Sustainability and Adaptation}, I have also come to understand that my engineering knowledge can be used for research, the development of new technologies or processes, and to influence policies. \hl{Repeated DST and CCSA. Could even include Sunamp. Maybe this example is one too many...}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{P2(i, b, m)}

I have gained a knowledge of the characteristics of, an understanding of and an ability to use a range of computer-based tools, building services products, and engineering processes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item P2i 
     
     In \textit{Environment and Behaviour}, \textit{Laboratory Project} and \textit{Dissertation}, I developed an ability to use the statistics software tool SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Science).
     The course \textit{Statistics for Science} provided me with a foundation to understand the data in the inputs and outputs of this software.
    
    \item P2i and P2
    
    In \textit{Design Software Applications} and \textit{Laboratory Project}, I gained an in-depth understanding of the characteristics of steady-state and dynamic building modelling and energy analysis software programmes, notably iSBEM, SAP, IES, and CFD.
    As these courses only provided an introduction to these software programmes, I have not mastered my ability to use them.
    This was demonstrated during my attempt to model my \textit{Design Project} building in IES; my building model overheated due to variation and temperature profiles that I had incorrectly set up, amongst other things.
    
    During the \textit{Design Project} and my placements at Hultin \& Lundquist Arkitekter and Sunamp, I gained an understanding of and an ability to use Autocad.
    Likewise, I learned to use Revit during the \textit{Design Project} and my placements at Arup and Hoare Lea.
    Although my ability to use these Autodesk products (i.e. Autocad and Revit) is limited, I have learned quite a bit about their characteristics.
    In \textit{Dissertation} and \textit{Innovation in Construction Practice}, I learned about the prominent use of these products in the UK construction industry and how their proprietary characteristics can lead to problems of interoperability.
    
    Regarding engineering processes, I have learned extensively about the BIM process in Dissertation and Innovation in Construction Practice.
    I have also learned the characteristics of and practised the optimisation process of an engineering design in \textit{Laboratory Project} (see EA3(i, b, m) in Section \ref{EA} for more detail \hl{is this the correct reference where I expand on the optimisation of cooling coil?}).
    
    \item P2m
    
    I have gathered an extensive knowledge and understanding of a wide range of building services products (e.g. heat pumps, heat batteries, photovoltaic panels) and building materials (e.g. phase-change materials, Ziegel blocks, steel)
    throughout many of my construction-based courses, i.e. 
    \textit{Construction Technology 1},
    \textit{Building Services Technology},
    \textit{Design Project A},
    \textit{Construction Technology 2},
    \textit{Acoustics and Architectural Design},
    \textit{Design Project B},
    \textit{Critical Architectural Studies},
    \textit{Electrical and Lighting Services for Buildings},
    \textit{Design Software Applications},
    \textit{Energy and Buildings},
    \textit{Thermal Performance Studies},
    \textit{Design Project},
    \textit{Laboratory Project},
    \textit{Sustainable and Intelligent Buildings},
    \textit{Innovation in Construction Practice},
    and \textit{Water Supply and Drainage for Buildings},
    and my placements at Sunamp, Hoare Lea and Arup
\end{itemize}
\hl{Write about increase in knowledge throughout the years. P2m for example couldn't all of a sudden have been achieved in Y5.}

%Building materials: insulation, steel, wood, Ziegel blocks, glass, PCMs etc.

%Building services products: ACs, HPs, PV, AHUs, Sunamp, windcatchers


\subsection*{P3(i, -)}

\hl{I have had laboratory practice in the realms of physics, chemistry and biology in high school (mention?).}
In university, my knowledge and understanding of laboratory practice began to further develop in Year 2 when I conducted experiments in \textit{Construction Technology 2}, \textit{Acoustics and Architectural Design}, \textit{Hydraulics and Hydrology A} and \textit{Energy Principles and Applications}.
The feedback for these lab reports (\hl{respectively ..., 93\% and ...}) demonstrate my knowledge and understanding of laboratory practice.

In Years 3 and 4, I gained the ability to apply practical and laboratory skills that were more relevant to Architectural Engineering through my increased exposure to and application of laboratory practice in thermofluids and acoustics.
I re-visited the Services lab another two times for thermofluids-related experiments in \textit{Thermal Performance Studies} and \textit{Laboratory Project} and re-used my practical skills of recording, measuring and analysing sounds in \textit{Critical Architectural Studies} and \textit{Laboratory Project}.
\hl{What actions and results can I show as evidence of my practical skills?}


\subsection*{P4(i, -)}

The technical literature I have been exposed to includes Sunamp's manuals for their UniQ product range and the product information sheets I drew up for them.
These sheets included information such as temperature input and output ranges, wiring diagrams, and the dimensions of the heat batteries.
\hl{Include evidence, e.g. attach PISs}

I also came across and used technical literature during my \textit{Design Project}.
I used product specifications to size the college's water storage tank \citep{Decca}, calorifiers and buffer vessels \citep{RycroftLtd} etc.

Throughout my \textit{Design Project} and Sunamp experiences, I gained an understanding of the use of technical literature.
During the Design Project, I used technical literature to appropriately size some of the building services, both to accommodate the needs of the building's occupants and to fit inside of the plant room.
At Sunamp, I was part of the decision-making process of the information that should be included in the product information sheets, what would be one of the first documents a customer would see once they have taken interest in Sunamp's products.
It was decided that information such as dimensions and weight were important to, firstly, highlight the compact size of Sunamp's batteries (which is one of their unique selling points) and, secondly, give the customers an indication of the transportation and placement requirements of a battery (e.g. it may need to be carried by two people and it needs to be placed on a load-bearing floor).
\hl{Perhaps do not be afraid to write more sentences and give details such as specific weights and dimensions, and talk about stacking batteries and load bearing floors vs shelves etc.}


\subsection*{P5}

Considering that in \hl{AHEP} defines ``knowledge" as information that can be recalled, I do not have much knowledge of legal and contractual issues relevant to Architectural Engineering.
We have, however, covered \hl{contracts...} in \textit{Procurement and Contracts} and professional liability and insurance in \textit{Design Issues}.
It is perhaps due to a lack of coursework or examination and/ or a lack of spaced repetition of these topics throughout my degree programme that have I not gained a firm knowledge in relevant legal and contractual issues.


\subsection*{P6(i, -)}

I have used appropriate codes of practice and industry standards during \textit{Design Project}, \textit{Inclusive and Safe Environments} and my placements at Hoare Lea and Sweco.
For the \textit{Design Project}, for example, I wanted to use water source heat pumps (WSHPs) to generate heat for the college since it was located right next to a body of water \hl{(see Figure ...).}
I had to figure out how WSHPs could fit into the building's heating strategy.
To do this, I read about WHSPs in CIBSE CP2, the UK's Code of Practice for surface WSHPs.
I decided, because the college was a large non-domestic facility, to use a multi-valent heating system, where the WSHPs would provide the base heating load and some micro combined heat and power (CHP) units would satisfy the peak heating demands \citep[pp.~12,~38]{CP22016}.
\hl{I have no feedback to demonstrate this specifically was good and my grade for DP wasn't good because of missing elements...}


\subsection*{P7}


\subsection*{P8}

I think part of \hl{my failure?} of the Design Project was my inability to work with technical uncertainty.
I have a tendency to be detail-oriented and thus get stuck in details etc., to not take risks and to be indecisive
But I did (painstakingly) work through some uncertainties, thus achieving a passing grade (?).
