I have had a total of six work placements since the start of my gap year.
Figure~\ref{timeline} provides a timeline of the companies I have worked at.
The focus of this chapter will be on my placement at Sunamp, which was specifically done as part of my \textit{Industrial Project}; I will briefly describe my other work experiences.
Each placement is described in a section, and these are in chronological order.
Hence, Sunamp is described in Section~\ref{sec:sunamp}.
