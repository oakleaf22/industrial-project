I have had a total of six work placements since the start of my gap year.
Figure~\ref{timeline} provides a timeline of the companies I have worked at.
The focus of this chapter will be on my placement at Sunamp, which was specifically done as part of my \textit{Industrial Project}.
After describing my experience at Sunamp, I will briefly describe my other work experiences in reverse chronological order.

\subsection*{The Company}

Sunamp is a newly established business that specialises in the research, production and sales of heat batteries that are based on phase change materials (PCMs).
The PCMs, developed and manufactured by Sunamp, are non-toxic, non-flammable, eco-friendly and patented in the UK and China, with patents pending in other countries 
%\hl{cite Sunamp's website}.
\citep{SunampAutomotive}.
The PCMs operate at different temperatures, allowing the storage of heat (up to 1000$^{\circ}$C) or coolth (less than 0$^{\circ}$C) (see Figure~\ref{pcm_temp_range}).
Currently, the company's main markets are buildings, where their heat batteries can generate hot water and space heating, and automobiles, where their heat batteries can refrigerate transported goods (for example).

	\caption{The temperature range of Sunamp's PCMs in degrees Celsius \citep{SunampAutomotive}.}
	\label{pcm_temp_range}
\end{figure}


Sunamp was founded by Andrew Bissell, who is the chief executive officer (CEO), and is based in Macmerry, East Lothian.
They have a small office building, which features a workshop and chemistry laboratory on the ground floor and an open-plan office on the first floor, and a factory across the road where they have additional test facilities but primarily do large-scale manufacturing %and packaging 
of heat batteries.
Around 20 people work in the office and five in the factory.

	\label{fig:handwarmer}
\end{wrapfigure}

If you have ever gone camping, you might have come across crystallisation-type reusable hand warmers (pictured in Figure~\ref{fig:handwarmer}).
Such hand warmers are filled with a PCM called sodium acetate and contain a little metal disk.
The sodium acetate is liquid at room temperature.
When you bend the metal disk, the sodium acetate gradually crystallises and releases heat 
(see a video of the crystallisation process here: 
\url{https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Hand_warmer_activation.webm} \citep{HandWarmerActivation}).
The pack becomes completely solid and continues to release heat for a while.
The hand warmer is reusable because you can turn the sodium acetate back into a liquid by immersing the pack in boiling water for about ten to 15 minutes.

The principle that makes hand warmers work is \emph{latent heat}.
Latent heat is the thermal energy required to change the phase of a substance (e.g. from a solid to a liquid, or a liquid to a gas) without it changing temperature (see Figure~\ref{fig:latentheat}).
Latent heat can be thought of as the energy required to make or break the molecular bonds within a substance, thereby changing its state.

%For example, take a PCM that melts at 58$^{\circ}$C.
Water is an example of a PCM.
%Water freezes at 0$^{\circ}$C, and in reverse, ice melts at 0$^{\circ}$C.
When you put water in a cold environment, like a freezer, it exchanges heat with the environment: the water loses latent heat and becomes solid ice at 0$^{\circ}$C, and the environment gains heat, becoming somewhat warmer.
When you put the solid ice in a warm environment, the reverse happens: the ice gains latent heat and becomes liquid water at 0$^{\circ}$C, and the environment loses heat, becoming somewhat cooler.
%When you put ice in a warm environment, it exchanges heat with the environment: the ice gains latent heat and becomes liquid water at 0$^{\circ}$C, and the environment loses heat, becoming somewhat cooler.
%When you put the liquid water back in a cold environment such as a freezer, the reverse happens: the water loses latent heat and becomes solid ice at 0$^{\circ}$C, and the environment gains heat, becoming somewhat warmer.

%Sunamp's heat batteries are ``scaled up" versions of crystallisation-type hand warmers.
%They charge (i.e. absorb heat) when heat is added to the battery, e.g. via piped hot water running through the battery or via an electrical heating element inside the battery.
%They then discharge (i.e. release heat) when piped cold water runs through the battery, thereby exchanging heat with the water.
%The hot water that is discharged from the battery can be used for space heating and hot water purposes in buildings.

Sunamp's latest range of heat batteries is called \emph{UniQ} (see Figure~\ref{fig:uniq_range}).
Why?
\emph{Uni} because it is the ``one and only energy storage solution you need for" \emph{Q}, the ``engineering symbol for Heat Energy" \citep{UniQ_Leaflet}.
The UniQ batteries are ``scaled up" versions of crystallisation-type hand warmers.
There are two series of UniQ batteries: standard batteries and e-batteries.
Broadly speaking, a standard UniQ battery consists of a highly insulated box which contains a finned-tube heat exchanger and a PCM which fills the space around the heat exchanger (see cross-sections in Figure~\ref{fig:cross-section-draft}).
The tubes of the heat exchanger protrude from the box, allowing pipe connections to serve as hot and cold water inlets to the battery, as well as hot water and space heating outlets from the battery.
A UniQ e-battery has a similar construction, except it also contains an electrical heating element.
A battery charges (i.e. its PCM absorbs heat) when heat is added to it, e.g. via piped hot water running through a standard battery or by switching on the electrical heating element inside an e-battery.
A battery then discharges (i.e. its PCM releases heat) when piped cold water runs through it, the warm PCM thereby exchanging heat with the cold water.
The hot water that is discharged from the battery can be used for space heating and hot water purposes in buildings.

\subsection*{Why Heat Batteries?}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.4\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/household-energy-consumption.jpg}
	\rule{0.4\textwidth}{0.5pt} % use line???
	\caption{Typical energy consumption of a UK home \citep{SunampResidential}.}
	\label{fig:domestic-energy}
\end{wrapfigure}

Batteries like the Tesla Powerwall have gained a lot of media attention recently for being able to store renewable electricity and shift demand etc.
However, in the UK (and probably other countries with a similar climate), over 80\% of domestic energy is used to generate heat for space heating and hot water (see Figure~\ref{fig:domestic-energy}).
Considering that the majority of UK households generate heat from natural gas, and some from fossil fuelled electricity, that causes a large carbon footprint.
Moreover, the current heat storage solutions are not as effective as they could be.
For example, in my flat, I have a direct hot water cylinder which turns on early every morning so that I have hot water as soon as I wake up.
But by the evening, the water is lukewarm or cold and, if I require any more hot water, I need to use more electricity to boost the hot water cylinder.
The poor heat storage capacity of my cylinder is probably due to its poor insulation, but perhaps also due to the relatively low heat capacity of water.
For a sustainable future, we need to be smarter about the way we generate and use heat, which is something we are evidently highly dependent on.

Sunamp’s UniQ heat batteries offer a smart solution to sustainable heat generation and consumption.
%Due to the high specific heat capacity of their PCMs, problems such as me re-boosting my hot water cylinder can be avoided.
%OR 
Due to the high heat capacity of their PCMs\footnote{
	I do not know the heat capacity of Sunamp's PCMs, but to get an idea, the heat capacity of sodium acetate can be as high as 229 $J/mol \cdot K$ \citep{Csodiumacetate} whereas that of water is 69.95 $J/mol \cdot K$ \citep{Cwater} according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
} and the low heat losses of their batteries, an excessive amount of energy does not need to be used to generate or store heat (cf. my aforementioned hot water cylinder example).
Moreover, their heat batteries can be charged by any energy source, including renewable and/ or environmentally friendly technologies such as PVs and heat pumps. %, which are energy generation solutions for a sustainable future.
%Furthermore, with thoughts to electrify heat in the UK (as grid electricity gradually becomes decarbonised), 
UniQ e-batteries also allow for demand-side management (DSM) which helps with grid balancing, e.g. by shifting electricity demands from peak periods, thus reducing the strain on the national electricity supply system (see Figure~\ref{fig:DSM}).
DSM might become an increasingly important strategy since there have been thoughts to electrify heat in the UK as grid electricity gradually becomes decarbonised.

Other key features of UniQ batteries include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Instant hot water at mains pressure
	\item Rapid warm-up of your heating system, e.g. radiators
	\item Significantly reduced legionella risk, since there is hardly any risk of water stagnating or being between 20$^{\circ}$C and 45$^{\circ}$C inside the battery \citep{HSE_legionella}
	\item Compact, between two and four times smaller than the equivalent hot water cylinders
	\item Reliable, with a lifespan of at least 50 years
	\item Modular: the batteries can easily be combined to increase heat storage
	\item You can save money by charging your e-battery during off-peak periods with variable rate electricity tariffs, e.g. Economy 10

\subsection*{Description of Work Experience}

	\rule{0.4\textwidth}{0.5pt} % use line???
	\caption{My place at Sunamp.}
	\label{fig:bridge}
\end{wrapfigure}

My placement at Sunamp started on Tuesday 3\textsuperscript{rd} July 2018 and ended on Friday 10\textsuperscript{th} August 2018.
I worked a total of 198 hours across six weeks, averaging at about 6.8 hours of work per day (see log in Appendix~\ref{App:Log} \hl{is there a need to blur out sensitive info?}).

I joined Sunamp in the wake of the development of UniQ.
UniQ had been developed by Sunamp's engineers and explained in a manual.
However, the manual was too large and technical for the sales team to understand, navigate and use to efficiently match customers with the most suitable UniQ products.
Therefore, my purpose at Sunamp was to bridge the gap between Engineering and Sales (see Figure~\ref{fig:bridge}).
This was to be done by creating concise and user-friendly documentation that would introduce and explain the UniQ range to customers and even be used by the sales team as an aide-memoire.
This project mainly consisted of me presenting existing content in new ways and boiling down a lot of technical documentation/ material into meaningful and useful information for customers.

My time at Sunamp can roughly be divided up into two aspects: learning about Sunamp's work and development, and
% \hl{producing work for Sunamp/ }
carrying out my UniQ project.

\subsection{Learning About Sunamp}

The majority of my first week at Sunamp consisted of my familiarisation with the company and their products.
The week started with an induction from Susan Lang-Bissell, the managing director (MD), where we went over my contract, office information, health and safety regulations (amongst other things) and I got a brief tour of the factory.
The induction was followed by an introduction from Joan Pisanek (the Business Development Manager) to UniQ and some of Sunamp's projects.
I used the rest of the week to familiarise myself with and try to understand their products by consulting Joan's PowerPoint presentations and the UniQ manuals,
% working through Joan's Buchlyvie project (\hl{see Appendix ...}), 
and attempting a UniQ Product Training Exercise developed by Sandy.

Santokh Gataora, colloquially known as Sandy, is Sunamp's Technical Director.
He has a vast experience in building services engineering and has helped develop the UniQ product range.
He writes and continues to refine the UniQ manuals as he guides the company in the engineering and application aspects of UniQ heat batteries in buildings.
% When I joined the company, UniQ was a very recent development that the sales team was still learning about.
% The week I arrived at Sunamp, Sandy had sent out an exercise for the sales team to complete for the following week's UniQ Product Training Workshop.
% The exercise instructions and my answer \hl{can be found in Appendix ... blur out people's names in email}.
During my second week, I attended the UniQ Product Training Workshop, where the sales team and I learned about the UniQ product range in greater depth and briefly went over the solution to the aforementioned exercise.
%\hl{Comment on my answer vs. solution?}

During my second and third weeks at Sunamp, I received more thorough tours of the factory, workshop and chemistry laboratory.
At the factory I got an understanding of the construction of the heat batteries.
\begin{comment}
This broadly consists of the selection of a heat exchanger, 
the installation of the heat exchanger and thermometer inside an insulated container, 
the pouring of the PCM into the container, 
the sealing of the container, 
and the cooling-off of the finalised heat battery for the next few days \hl{not an essential step of the assembly - could mention amazing heat retention properties when describing UniQ}.
\hl{Sketch cross-section of heat battery! Am I allowed though?}
\end{comment}
I touched a heat battery that had been assembled some days before and left to cool off; it was \emph{still warm} -- I was amazed by its impressively low heat losses!

During the workshop and laboratory tour, I gained a deeper understanding of the making and performance of the PCMs and the selection of materials that go inside a heat battery.
Some of the things I learned are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The high energy density of the PCMs is what allows Sunamp's heat batteries to be between two and four times smaller than their equivalent hot water cylinders.
    \item Sunamp's chemists cycle and analyse PCM mixtures through solid-liquid and liquid-solid phase transitions to assess the stability of the mixtures' phase transitions over time. The more stable the transitions are, the more suitable they are to be used in heat batteries.
    %\item The chemists also need to test their supplier's materials for impurities which can significantly degrade the performance of PCM mixtures.
    \item Different PCM mixtures can react differently to aluminium and copper, the main metals that heat exchangers are built from.
    Sunamp typically uses all-aluminium finned-tube heat exchangers, but they will sometimes create a PCM which corrodes aluminium.
    In these cases they might need to consider using copper-based heat exchangers, which are more expensive but might work out cheaper in the long-run when compared to the capital and operational costs of the heat batteries' equivalent hot water cylinders.
    \hl{reword to sound less alarming or give less info?}
    %\item Working with cold, medium and high temperature ranges, the chemists need to ensure that the plastic material of the container which holds the PCM can tolerate that PCM's temperature range. Therefore Sunamp typically uses different materials for containers that carry cold and warm/ hot PCMs.
\end{itemize}

During my fourth and fifth weeks at Sunamp, I attended two presentations.
The first was a summary of the research carried out by two chemistry students that had spent the past year working on their dissertation projects at Sunamp.
I gained some insight into the technical aspects of the development of PCMs and was impressed that one of the student's PCMs might soon become patented and used for refrigeration in vehicles.
Sandy gave the second presentation which was an overview of the new UniQ product range to the whole company.
I think this was especially insightful for the chemists and engineers who are specialised in their specific areas and might not always see how all of their work contributes to the end-product (heat batteries) and their application (heating space and water in buildings).

During my last week, I was part of the tour and planning of Sunamp's Experience Room.
This room is designed to look and feel like a home, with a kitchen-like decor and sink in one corner.
One of the purposes of this room, which was still under construction, is to showcase Sunamp's heat batteries to customers by comparing them to their large equivalents on the common marketplace (e.g. hot water cylinders) and by showing how they integrate into a building and its systems (e.g. heat pumps
and boilers).
The room is also planned to be used for training workshops on the installation of Sunamp's heat batteries.

Throughout my brief placement at Sunamp, there has been a sense of rapid development and expansion.
The company started out by manufacturing batteries inside a small workshop, which has now grown into a factory which is still evolving with the construction of new testing facilities and training/ marketing spaces.
The company continues to recruit more engineers and scientists.
It also seems like more customers are hearing about and taking interest in Sunamp's heat batteries, in the UK and abroad.

\subsection{My UniQ Project} \label{sec:sunamp_work}

%\hl{Decide on section title!}

% Ohhhh come on! I gotta write! Just blow off some steam. It doesn't have to be all thought out and structured to begin with. Just keep the hand on the keyboard and type! As Moira says, "Be confident." :D

I started working on my project during my second week at Sunamp and completed it during my last week.
From my log, I have deducted that I worked at least 138 hours on this project, which accounts for 70\% of my time at Sunamp.
This includes the time I spent working autonomously, in meetings, and my final presentation.

I ended up creating a series of documents about UniQ, most of which are illustrated in Figure~\ref{funnel}.
The documents formed a hierarchy, from very generic information at the top to more specific information going down.
This funneling of information reflects the customer's journey, from the time they become aware of a product until they decide to purchase it.
\hlc[cyan]{
When I was preparing for my presentation, I discovered that my funnel resembles a marketing strategy/ concept called the marketing funnel.
This starts out by making customers aware of the product and then increasingly provides more specific information as a customer becomes more interested until they decide to purchase the product.}
\hlc[green]{On reflection...
This corroborated/ validated my use of the funnel.}
At the top of the funnel were documents that introduced and gave an overview of the UniQ product range.
These consisted of the Overview Sheet and UniQ Product Selection Quiz.
At the next level of the funnel were documents that provided specific information about the individual UniQ products; these were called the Product Information Sheets (PISs).
At the bottom of the funnel was a document that provided installation guidelines for the UniQ batteries.


\begin{figure}[htbp]

	\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt} % use line???
	\caption{The main outcomes of my UniQ project, ranked by a funnel-shaped hierarchy.}
	\label{funnel}
\end{figure}


Outside the heart of my project, embodied by the information funnel in Figure~\ref{funnel}, I carried out a couple other tasks.
Among these was \hl{a document} I produced that contained additional information that was to be included in Sunamp's upcoming UniQ brochure.
Also, at the end of my placement, I gave a presentation to Sunamp's core staff, including the CEO, about my placement work.

The following sections will discuss my work in more detail.



\subsubsection{UniQ Overview Sheet}

I had not been asked to create a sheet that gave an overview of the UniQ product range.
I, however, thought it might be helpful to ease the customers' introduction to and understanding of UniQ.
The final Overview Sheet (see Appendix~\ref{App:Overview}) introduces the UniQ battery by showing the possible inputs (renewables, heat and/ or electricity) and outputs (space heating and/ or hot water).
The battery is flexible when it comes to its inputs: these can range from boilers to heat pumps, and from grid electricity to PV panels.
Furthermore, the sheet features some catchy ways to describe UniQ, including the tag line ``Make your heating solution UniQ", that I came up with.
\hlc[green]{On reflection, the sheet misses the point of getting a heat battery. Why would I get a battery if I already have the means to generate space heating and hot water. I think this was raised during the meeting by Andrew and was to be rectified after I left.}

It turned out that Sunamp already had a diagram showing the inputs and outputs of a UniQ battery.
However, the staff considered using mine over their original diagram in the UniQ brochure.



\subsubsection{UniQ Product Selection Quiz} \label{sec:quiz}

As I was working on the PISs, the question of how a customer would know which UniQ product was most suitable to them \hl{loomed} in my mind.
``How will they even know which PIS to read?"
That is when I thought of creating a quiz in the form of a decision tree that would ask customers questions and guide them to the most suitable UniQ product for them based on their answers.
An added benefit of the quiz was that it would allow customers to explore the UniQ range easier and more informed, which would cut some of the sales team's initial \hl{customer-product match-making/ interface work}.

Figure~\ref{fig:quiz_draft} shows my first draft of the quiz.
I showed this to Joan when I pitched the quiz idea to her.
The idea was well received by her and Susan, so it escalated to another one of my sub-projects.
After creating a more polished second draft, I asked Sandy to give his expert feedback.
He responded with a re-arranged and more sophisticated decision tree.
This was the start of a process of iterations where I asked staff members for further feedback in order to refine the quiz design.
The full-sized version of the final quiz (Figure~\ref{fig:quiz_final}) can been found in Appendix~\ref{App:quiz}.

\subsubsection{UniQ Product Information Sheets (PISs)} \label{sec:piss}

Sandy asked me to produce a PIS for each of the UniQ products.
He gave me an outline of the type of information that would be included on each sheet, e.g. a brief description of the product and its operation, a diagram, and battery sizing information.
%, hydraulic connections, a wiring diagram, and a ``Do's and Don'ts!" list.
Every PIS was limited to two sides of an A4 page.

\end{wrapfigure}

To accomplish this task, I used a variety of resources.
I obtained the relevant content from Sunamp's UniQ manuals and other documents.
Sometimes, however, the manuals were unclear or contradictory, e.g. regarding the dimensions of the UniQ batteries.
Therefore, to ensure accuracy of the PISs' content, I conducted little investigations e.g. measuring the dimensions of the UniQ batteries in the factory.
For the layout and presentation, I drew inspiration from a couple PISs by Mitsubishi (see one example in Figure~\ref{mitsubishi}).
Similarly to the quiz, the production of the UniQ PISs was a process of iterations where I asked staff members (notably Joan and Sandy) for feedback throughout.
The creation of each UniQ PIS took around ten iterations or more.

During my fifth week at Sunamp, I took part in a meeting with Susan, Joan, the Executive Personal Assistant
% (PA)
% \hl{should I introduce abbreviations e.g. PA, CEO, PR and MD?}
and a Public Relations (PR) Specialist that had come into the office to discuss the design of the UniQ brochure.
We discussed incorporating the UniQ Overview Sheet, Product Selection Quiz and PISs in the brochure as well as their possible publication on the website and as flyers.
Since a professional designer would polish the appearance of my work, I was asked to focus more on the content and its accuracy than the presentation.
That is why I have not included the UniQ logo in the PISs, for example.
% on finalising the content and ensuring its accuracy rather than worrying about the presentation.
% Also, other decisions were made, e.g. to remove the hydraulic connections and wiring diagrams.

Before the PISs could be sent to the PR Relations Specialist, they needed to be reviewed and approved by Sandy and, ultimately, Andrew.
By the end of my placement, however, I did not get the opportunity to run the latest versions of the PISs by Andrew or Sandy.
In order to express my uncertainties of these drafts, I left the following message and amended the drafts accordingly:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``\textcolor{red}{Texts in red} express my uncertainties in their expression or phrasing; these may require amending. This includes all the taglines.
    \item ``I have expressed other uncertainties in comments in the document markups."
\end{itemize}

The UniQ PIS drafts that I left with Sunamp can be found in Appendix~\ref{App:PISs}.
Figure~\ref{breakdown} provides a breakdown of the PISs' structure and layout.



\subsubsection{UniQ Installation \& Operation (I\&O) Sheets}

Joan asked me to create documentation that presented important information that might affect the viability of using UniQ products in a system/ on a project, as well as answers to customers' frequently asked questions (FAQs).
``Will Sunamp install the UniQ battery for me?" and ``How will the UniQ battery integrate into my heating system?" are a couple FAQs, paraphrased.
It turned out that most of these questions were related to the installation and operation of UniQ batteries, hence why I have called them UniQ I\&O Sheets.

%The purpose of the I\&O Sheets was to provide customers with important information when they were considering or ready to purchase a UniQ battery.
Joan wanted the sheets to consist of an annotated floor plan, where one can see where/ how a UniQ battery fits into a home's heating and hot water set-up (see a draft in Appendix~\ref{App:ino}).
I, however, raised the point that a technical architectural drawing like a floor plan might not be easily interpreted by a customer.
I suggested that she may want a sheet with a greater visual impact, as exemplified in Figure~\ref{fig:installation}, or a completely different type of document.
After I started working on the UniQ PISs, Joan considered that the PISs might actually meet her needs better than the I\&O Sheets.
Still, she expressed a desire for the I\&O Sheets to be produced.
I therefore continued to work on the I\&O Sheets but I focused my attention on the PISs.

\subsubsection{Presenting my Placement Work}

During my last week, I gave a 20-minute presentation about the work I had produced to six members of Sunamp's core staff, including Andrew, Susan and Sandy.
(See PowerPoint in Appendix~\ref{App:Presentation}.)
When I presented the UniQ PISs, I gave each staff member a different printed copy of the PISs to examine more closely.
The presentation became quite interactive as I received feedback and we discussed the flow and improvement of the different UniQ documents.
The presentation was a constructive session as it made the core staff (most importantly Andrew) aware of my work and its potential usefulness to the company's marketing.
It was decided that the UniQ I\&O Sheets were not necessary and that some of the information presented on these sheets could be incorporated into the PISs.
The discussion also highlighted some aspects that I had failed to include in the documents by an oversight, notably explaining the interest in storing heat.
I was left with some pointers on last-minute improvements to make on the documents before I left.

\hlc[cyan]{Since I gave my presentation very close to the end of my placement, I did not have time to make all the corrections and improvements that had been highlighted during the presentation.}
\hlc[green]{On reflection, it could have been more constructive to give two presentations (first halfway through the placement and the second at the end) to allow time for me to implement their feedback.}

\subsubsection{My Contribution to Sunamp}

I contacted Joan and Susan in November 2018 and received an update on how I have contributed to Sunamp.
I was told that my work had not been included in the UniQ brochure because it had to be published quickly, but they are looking to include my material in the next brochure update due after Christmas.
Joan said that she personally used the work that I produced and that it helped her a lot.
Overall, though, Joan said that, ``The biggest legacy of your work here I think is that we now understand what we need in a design team, consisting of people with your experience and recruitment is due to start soon".

\subsection{Application Process}

I learned about the opportunity of two paid placements with immediate start at Sunamp through David Campbell, the D11PJ course leader.
He had asked applicants for this placement to send him 100 words broadly describing their strengths and preferences, which he would then forward to Sunamp.
Hamish, a coursemate of mine, and I were both interested in this opportunity.
\hl{My hundred-word application went as follows:}

Strengths:
\begin{itemize}
	\item I am very familiar with the BIM process, having written a dissertation on collaboration with regards to BIM.
	\item I have work experience in mechanical and electrical consulting engineering.
	\item Organised, flexible, independent and cooperative.
\end{itemize}
Skills:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Advanced skills in Microsoft Office packages and Bluebeam Revu.
	\item Intermediate skills in LaTeX.
	\item Basic modelling skills in Revit, AutoCAD and IES-VE.
	\item Fluent in three languages (English, Swedish and French) with basic knowledge of Spanish.
\end{itemize}
Preferences/ interests:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Highly interested in learning about your application of Phase Change Materials in thermal storage batteries.
	\item Also interested in working with BIM and learning Bentley’s Hevacomp software packages.
\end{itemize}

After the applications, David introduced the two of us to Susan Lang-Bissell, the Managing Director (MD) of Sunamp, via email.
David asked us to liaise with Susan to arrange a meeting.
To do this, Hamish and I first established our availabilities in the upcoming days.
I then volunteered to liaise with Susan via email on our behalf to find a suitable date and time.

\hl{Try to be more reflective, and less descriptive.
Maybe record (vocally) the story, and then reflect on it out loud. THEN write about it.}

\section{Sweco, August 2018}

%\subsection{Environmental Building Certification Summer Placement at Sweco in Malmö, Sweden}

I really enjoyed my placement at Sweco.
Unlike Sunamp, this more technical work was more along my lines of interest and more relevant to my education.
Upon reading about \textit{Miljöbyggnad}, the Swedish environmental building certification system, I was immediately drawing parallels to and comparing it to BREEAM, which I had learned about in Sustainable and Intelligent Buildings.

I think I would like to build my career in Sweden because it is a safe and profitable (?) place to work and live with many benefits, e.g.\ parental leave, and I would be close to my family.
I would really like to work towards improving the sustainability of buildings.
Sweden is pretty well known for their environmentally conscious efforts and their sustainability, e.g. with their recycling, their district heating systems, their high building standards with regards to U-values etc.
I think I could learn a lot about increasing sustainability in the built environment by working for an environmentally responsible construction or consulting company in Sweden.
Perhaps after that I will stay/ remain in Sweden or share my knowledge somewhere else in the world where it is more needed.
This is why I looked for a summer placement in Sweden this year, so I could ``get my foot in the door", make contacts and find opportunities for work once I graduate next year.

For the second year in a row, my application to Skanska had been rejected.
I tried to use my dad's contacts to get work, but these people never got back to me, despite my multiple attempts to reach them.
Sweco did not have an official summer placement application process, so I called the relevant regional head of Sweco's building services department.
He seemed interested to hear about my previous work experience, especially at Arup.
He contacted somebody else in the Malmo office, who invited me to interview.
My persistence to reach out to and politely remind the people of Sweco of my interest helped me obtain an offer to work with them.

Despite being Swedish, I have never gone to a school where the primary language of instruction was Swedish.
I am most confident in the English language and was aware from the start that my level in Swedish might pose a problem/ be a hurdle, both in layman's terms and construction-related jargon (which I have learned in English at Heriot-Watt University).
I made my supervisor aware of this from the start.
I found my general Swedish level improving daily.
Learning the Swedish jargon took a bit of time, questioning and looking up of words.
I found myself becoming more comfortable with the Swedish jargon during my brief three week placement at Sweco.
I believe with some more time I would eventually get the hang of it.
However, the work required some level of report writing in Swedish as well, which I was not entirely comfortable with.
I got through this though some autonomous exploration of how to phrase sentences etc. and a couple questions to my supervisor.
Either way, I have decided that, if I do end up working in Sweden, I will take a course to improve my Swedish.
This would improve my confidence to write reports and converse with colleagues in the workplace.

Other than that, my supervisor seemed really pleased with the work I had done, so much so that I was actually offered a job after graduation.
I was working on things like analysing solar heat gains, energy consumption, thermal comfort and daylighting in accordance with the \textit{Miljöbyggnad} methods and the Swedish building regulations (\textit{Boverkets Byggregler (BBR)}).

That is another thing I will need to learn about if I work in Sweden: their building regulations.
Although, that is something I would need to learn working anywhere, even the UK.

\section{Hoare Lea, August 2017}

%\subsection{Electrical Engineering Summer Placement at Hoare Lea in London}

Having recently studied Electrical and Lighting Services for Buildings and already tried out mechanical engineering at Arup, I wanted to explore the other half of M\&E (mechanical and electrical) engineering.

Just preparing for my interview for the Hoare Lea placement made me take some time to reflect on skills and attributes.
It also improved on my presentation-making skills.

Unfortunately due to having not-so-engaged supervisors, I do not think I learned as much about electrical engineering as I could have.
I practised drawing an electrical schematic by hand, on AutoCAD and on Amtech.
Despite not doing much, I did learn a bit about busbars, lighting and resilient cables.

I was also asked to draw fire detection and alarm drawings, which was an exercise I learned a lot from thanks to a couple fire specialists from Honeywell.
I read related building standards to ensure my design complied with them.

Hoare Lea is a building services consultancy.
The London office in which I worked housed many different disciplines.
I therefore took the opportunity to `roam' around and explore the different types of work that I could get into after university.
I would say my experience at Hoare Lea expanded/ broadened my horizons rather than deepened/ deepening my knowledge in a specific area.
I exposed myself to/ scraped the surface of/ was introduced to eight different specialities:
electrical engineering,
fire engineering,
building optimisation,
BIM,
acoustics,
sustainability,
façade access and
vertical transportation.
I was excited to learn about the breadth of work/ career opportunities within building services.
I gained a particular interest in the building optimisation speciality where one analyses the modelled and actual performance of buildings, advises clients on how to optimise the performance of their building and reduce running costs.
Thanks to my exposure to these specialities, I have been able to discover new and exciting career paths, of which I am considering working in building optimisation.

\section{Hultin \& Lundquist Arkitekter, June 2017}

%\subsection{Architecture Placement at Hultin \& Lundquist Arkitekter in Malmö, Sweden}

Tasks I did:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Produced window and door schedules on AutoCAD.
	\item Responsible for daylight calculations of a new-build during planning stage.
	\item Began a feasibility study on the construction of recycling sheds to five existing apartment buildings shortly before end of placement.
\end{itemize}

How did I progress or what did I learn during this placement?
I had to be creative in clearly displaying the numbers and types of doors, kitchens and apartments in schedules.
I also improved my conditional formatting skills in spreadsheets during my work on daylight calculations.
Practised my 2D AutoCAD skills again.
Took measurements to double-check the accuracy of outdated drawings.

%\subsection{Mechanical Engineering Summer Placement at Arup in Leeds}

In the summer after second year, I was excited to have earned a mechanical engineering placement with the world renowned company, Arup, in Leeds' Buildings team.
This placement gave me my first hands-on experience in designing and sizing heating, ventilation and water systems.
I was also introduced to some of the work the electrical engineers did.
The work experience prepared me for future courses such as Electrical and Lighting Services for Buildings and the fourth year Design Project.
I was encouraged to hear about Arup's sustainable mindset to designing and felt like I could become competent and may enjoy a job as a consulting engineer in the future.

\section{Hultin \& Lundquist Arkitekter, October - December 2013}

%\subsection{Architecture Placement at Hultin \& Lundquist Arkitekter in Malmö, Sweden}

During the first half of my gap year I was keen to gain work experience in architecture. I applied to all the architectural companies I could find in the Yellow Pages, with help from Ung Vision (Young Vision).
Ung Vision is a local initiative funded by Svedala council\footnote{\href{https://www.svedala.se/}{svedala.se}} with support from Arbetsförmedlingen (the Swedish Public Employment Service)\footnote{\href{https://www.arbetsformedlingen.se/Globalmeny/Other-languages/Languages/English-engelska.html}{arbetsformedlingen.se in English}} and Försäkringskassan (the Swedish Social Insurance Agency)\footnote{\href{https://www.forsakringskassan.se/privatpers/!ut/p/z1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8ziTTxcnA3dnQ28LdyNTQ0cAwMMjU38jby8gg30w_Wj9KOASgxwAEcD_YLsbEUAFUIRCA!!/dz/d5/L0lDUmlTUSEhL3dHa0FKRnNBLzROV3FpQSEhL2Vu/?keepNavState=true}{forsakringskassan.se in English}} that aims to help unemployed people between the ages of 16 and 24 find work \citep{ungvision:online}.
I eventually managed to get myself a ten-week paid placement at Hultin \& Lundquist Arkitekter, a small architectural practice which at the time consisted of two architects.

Working with buildings was very exciting for me; I would walk proudly with my clipboard, floor plan drawings and ruler to the 1960s apartment building the architects were going to refurbish.
I learned some of the rules used in architectural drawings and also gained some 2D modelling skills in  AutoCAD.
One of the things that still stands out to me today was how the building layout responded to the needs of the occupants in the 1960s.
Many flats had two entrances, which puzzled me until I was told that the larger door was the main entrance and the smaller a discreet `back' entrance for the servants.
Such nuggets of information/ history that explained the purpose behind the design was the beginning of my learning how design should be purposeful.
