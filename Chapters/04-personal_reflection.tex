\section{Professionalism}

A professional is someone that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Applies their body of knowledge with rigorous standards of skill, care and diligence,
    \item Seeks continuously to maintain up to date \& to improve knowledge \& skills in themselves and others,
    \item Is entirely trustworthy, ethical and acts with integrity.
    \item Fulfils an overriding duty to society/mankind and thereafter the client 
    \item Treats all people fairly \& with respect 
\end{itemize}

Points to discuss:
\begin{itemize}
    \item log (and then asked for it, glad on reflection for my initiative/ proactiveness);
    \item needing to be opportunistic rather than strategic to see Sandy (stats on number of meetings...);
    \item Applies their body of knowledge with rigorous standards of skill, care and diligence;
    \item personal project and carrying out a personal programme of work (G3);
    \item compilation of work produced.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Log Keeping}

During my first placement at Hultin \& Lundquist Arkitekter in 2013, I was asked to keep a timesheet which I was to submit on a monthly basis.
As I was getting paid an hourly rate, my salary was calculated from that timesheet.

When I started my placement at Arup in 2016, I knew from reading my contract that the company expected me to produce and submit a report about my placement by the end of it.
I therefore kept a daily diary where I jotted down notes about the work I had done and the things I had learned in addition to recording the hours I worked.
This not only facilitated the writing of the report, but also helped me monitor the progress of my tasks/ assignments and strengthen my knowledge acquisition.

From these experiences, I developed a habit of keeping a log at my following placements for my own benefit but also in case my employers required me to submit a timesheet.
Sometimes this was the case (e.g. at Hoare Lea and Sunamp), and other times it was not (e.g. at Sweco).
A month into my placement at Sunamp, for example, I was asked to submit a timesheet.
On reflection, I am glad for my proactivity in keeping a log at Sunamp since they did not inform me on the timesheet requirement at the start of my placement.

Due to the multiple benefits of logging, I continued to do so/ made it a habit at my following placements, even though I was not required to submit a report, except for the Industrial Project.

When I started my summer placement at Sunamp in 2018, I decided to keep a more systematic log to facilitate the writing of the Industrial Project report in the autumn.
