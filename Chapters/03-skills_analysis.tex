In this chapter I describe, analyse and demonstrate the knowledge and skills I have developed and gained throughout my university education
(see courses in Table~\ref{tbl:courses})
and work experiences in industry
(see placements in Figure~\ref{timeline}).
This has been done in line with the learning outcomes (LOs) stipulated by the Engineering Council for the university programmes that the council accredits (see Appendix~\ref{App:ECLOs}).
%, as well as the Graduate Attributes of Heriot-Watt University (see Appendix~\ref{App:HWgrad}).

I am studying an integrated Master of Engineering (MEng) degree in Architectural Engineering at Heriot-Watt University.
The degree is accredited by the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE), which is a licensed institution of the Engineering Council.
This means that when somebody joins CIBSE, they will also be registered as a Chartered Engineer (CEng), Incorporated Engineer (IEng) or Engineering Technician (EngTech) when they have reached the appropriate level of qualification and professional skill \citep{whyjoinCIBSE}.

The Engineering Council has 42 LOs for the degree programmes it accredits.
These are divided up into six categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Science and mathematics (SM)
    \item Engineering analysis (EA)
    \item Design (D)
    \item Economic, legal, social, ethical and environmental context (EL)
    \item Engineering practice (P)
    \item Additional general skills (G)
\end{itemize}
Each category has a list of LOs which are depicted by the category abbreviation (e.g. SM) and a number (e.g. 1); examples of LOs are SM1, EA2 and D3.
Most of these LOs are divided into, at the most, three incrementally increasing attainment levels which are depicted by the letters ``i", ``b" or ``m", e.g. SM1i, SM1b and SM1m.
From the \textit{UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence} (UK-SPEC) \citep{EngineeringCouncil2014}, 
I have been able to deduce that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{``i"} represents the LOs of Bachelors Degrees and Bachelors (Honours) Degrees accredited for IEng registration.
    \item \textbf{``b"} represents the LOs of Bachelors (Honours) Degrees accredited as partially meeting the educational requirement for CEng registration.
    \item \textbf{``m"} represents the LOs of integrated Masters (MEng) degrees accredited for CEng registration.
\end{itemize}

Some LOs are only divided into two attainment levels, one of which is not depicted by a letter ``i", ``b" or ``m", e.g. EA2i and EA2.
In such cases, the LO with the letter ``i", ``b" or ``m" applies to the corresponding attainment level and the LO without the letter applies to all the other attainment levels.
In the example of EA2i and EA2, EA2 applies to both attainment levels ``b" and ``m".

Other LOs, however, are not depicted by any of the letters ``i", ``b" or ``m", e.g. D6.
These LOs therefore apply to all three of the attainment levels.\footnote{
For consistency, I have amended seven of the LO abbreviations given to us in the D11PJ Course Handbook.
The LOs D3, EL3, EL6, P2, P11 and G3 were respectively changed to D3i, EL3b, EL6b, P2b, P11b and G3b.
Since the LOs P4 and P4m are identical, I have merged them to the single LO P4.
These amendments were done so that the naming conventions described above always apply.}


%I have developed a skills matrix (see Appendix~\ref{App:matrix}) in which I show the courses and placements where I have developed each LO attainment level.
I have developed a skills matrix (see Appendix~\ref{App:matrix}) in which I show the extent to which each course or work placement has contributed to my achievement of each LO.
I have used three symbols to depict my level of achievement
and have attributed a numerical value to each (see Table~\ref{tbl:symbols}).


\begin{table}[htbp]
	\caption{The achievement level symbols used in this report.}
	\label{tbl:symbols}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
		\toprule
		\textbf{Symbol} & \littlemaster & \nomaster & \master \\ \midrule
		\textbf{Achievement level} & Limited & Above average & Full \\
		\textbf{Numerical value} & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ \bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}



\begin{wraptable}[5]{r}{0.3\textwidth}
	\centering
	\caption{Example box}
	\label{tbl:example_box}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|}
		\hline
		\rowcolor[HTML]{F8A102} 
		\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\cellcolor[HTML]{F8A102}\textbf{LO(i, b, m) \littlemaster / \nomaster / \master}} \\ \hline
		Course codes \\
		Work placements \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{wraptable}

The approach of my skills analysis in this chapter is competency-based.
I have grouped the attainment levels of the LOs, such as SM1(i, b, m) and EA2(i, -), where the dash ``-" depicts the LO without ``i", ``b" or ``m" as an ending letter.
Each LO is presented with a box, like the one in Table \ref{tbl:example_box}.
The box lists the codes of the courses and the companies I have worked at that helped me achieve that LO.
(I sometimes abbreviate the company name ``Hultin \& Lundquist Arkitekter" to ``H\&L" to make it fit neatly in the boxes.)
An achievement level symbol will show my overall achievement of the LO, considering all of its attainment levels (i, b and m).
If there is no symbol in the box, this means that I have not achieved that LO.

The UK-SPEC uses the following terms and their definitions, which will also apply within this report \citep{EngineeringCouncil2014}:
%\hl{Re-arranged extract from AHEP 3rd edition}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Awareness} is general familiarity, albeit bounded by the needs of the specific discipline

    \item \textbf{Knowledge} is information that can be recalled

    \item \textbf{Understanding} is the capacity to use concepts creatively, for example, in problem solving, design, explanations and diagnosis

    \item \textbf{Skills} are acquired and learned attributes that can be applied almost automatically

    \item \textbf{Know-how} is the ability to apply learned knowledge and skills to perform operations intuitively, efficiently and correctly

    \item \textbf{Complex} implies engineering problems, artefacts or systems that involve dealing simultaneously with a sizeable number of factors that interact and require deep understanding, including knowledge at the forefront of the discipline, to analyse or deal with

\end{itemize}
