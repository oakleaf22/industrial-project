\section{Science and Mathematics (SM)}

\subsection*{SM1(i, b, m)}

Multiple courses (mainly from years 2 and 3) have contributed to my knowledge and understanding of scientific principles and methodology necessary to underpin my education in Architectural Engineering.
A main contributor was \textit{Thermal Performance Studies}.
On this course I learned the scientific principles of psychrometrics, i.e. the properties of air-vapour mixtures (especially/ like air), and how to use this knowledge in the design of air conditioners, heat exchangers and cooling towers.
Learning about the environmental effects of refrigerants has contributed to my understanding of the evolution of air conditioners, from using carbon and fluoride based refrigerants to water and eventually phase change materials (PCMs) like Sunamp uses.

Learning the scientific principles of related disciplines have helped me enrich my appreciation of the scientific and engineering context of my discipline.
\textit{Statistics for Science} has, for example, helped me understand the proper methodology behind sampling populations and to identify when bias in data.
\textit{Hydraulics and Hydrology A}, a civil engineering course, helped me appreciate the hydrological cycle (relevant to rainwater/ urban drainage) and water flow in pipes (relevant to drainage, water supply and heating systems).


\subsection*{SM2(i, b, m)}

\textit{Mathematics for Engineers and Scientists 1 and 2} and \textit{Statistics for Science} all further developed my knowledge and understanding of mathematical and statistical methods.
I have been able to apply this knowledge in the analysis and solution of engineering problems.
For example, I used it to work out the yield of an array of photovoltaic panels (PV) in \textit{Energy and Buildings} as well as the yield of a set of turbines in a tidal energy generation system as part of my group project in \textit{Design Project}.


\subsection*{SM3(b, m)}

Other engineering disciplines that I have gained knowledge and understanding from are predominantly civil and structural.
These were acquired through the following courses: \textit{Mechanics B}, \textit{Construction Technology 1 and 2},  and \textit{Hydraulics and Hydrology A}.
pipes etc
materials choice?
