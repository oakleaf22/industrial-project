This report describes the content of my work experiences, focusing on my placement at Sunamp which was done in conjunction with the \IPTitle \space (\IP).
It then goes on to analyse and demonstrate my achievement of the learning outcomes of the Architectural Engineering programme, as defined by the Engineering Council.
The analysis considers skills I have gained during my education at Heriot-Watt University and my work placements.
A matrix in Appendix~\ref{App:matrix} summarises the extent to which I have acquired the learning outcomes throughout all my courses and placements.
Lastly, the report ends with a personal reflection on my professionalism in the workplace, academic performance and future career aspirations.
